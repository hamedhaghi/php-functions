extract â€” Import variables into the current symbol table from an array

Description

extract ( array &$array [, int $flags = EXTR_OVERWRITE [, string $prefix = NULL ]] ) : int
Import variables from an array into the current symbol table.

Checks each key to see whether it has a valid variable name. It also checks for collisions with existing variables in the symbol table.

Warning
Do not use extract() on untrusted data, like user input (e.g. $_GET, $_FILES).

Parameters 

array
An associative array. This function treats keys as variable names and values as variable values. For each key/value pair it will create a variable in the current symbol table, subject to flags and prefix parameters.

You must use an associative array; a numerically indexed array will not produce results unless you use EXTR_PREFIX_ALL or EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID.

flags
The way invalid/numeric keys and collisions are treated is determined by the extraction flags. It can be one of the following values:

EXTR_OVERWRITE
If there is a collision, overwrite the existing variable.
EXTR_SKIP
If there is a collision, don't overwrite the existing variable.
EXTR_PREFIX_SAME
If there is a collision, prefix the variable name with prefix.
EXTR_PREFIX_ALL
Prefix all variable names with prefix.
EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID
Only prefix invalid/numeric variable names with prefix.
EXTR_IF_EXISTS
Only overwrite the variable if it already exists in the current symbol table, otherwise do nothing. This is useful for defining a list of valid variables and then extracting only those variables you have defined out of $_REQUEST, for example.
EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS
Only create prefixed variable names if the non-prefixed version of the same variable exists in the current symbol table.
EXTR_REFS
Extracts variables as references. This effectively means that the values of the imported variables are still referencing the values of the array parameter. You can use this flag on its own or combine it with any other flag by OR'ing the flags.
If flags is not specified, it is assumed to be EXTR_OVERWRITE.

prefix
Note that prefix is only required if flags is EXTR_PREFIX_SAME, EXTR_PREFIX_ALL, EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID or EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS. If the prefixed result is not a valid variable name, it is not imported into the symbol table. Prefixes are automatically separated from the array key by an underscore character.

Return Values
Returns the number of variables successfully imported into the symbol table.
